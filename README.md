# my-gimp-plugins


A personal set of testing GIMP plugins coded in Python (some code is taken or based on scripts found on https://github.com/akkana/gimp-plugins, thanks)

*Great documentation on how to write python Scripts for the GIMP [here(IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-autogimp/index.html)*  


## Contents

* [Python](./python)
* [Script Fu (Scheme)](./script-fu)


### Notes
Make sure your python code is exexutable, i.e. `chmod +x mycode.py`, otherwise Gimp ont be able to execute them. Also, make sure to use the python version gimp uses.
